# Epistemic Asymmetry in Cognitive Systems

## Three Types of Information Loss

### 1. Abstraction Loss
- During abstraction, we systematically discard information deemed irrelevant
- Edge detection discards gradients, object recognition discards details
- We cannot recover what was considered irrelevant
- Creates one-way information flow: many inputs map to one abstraction

### 2. Learning Loss
- We forget the specific experiences that shaped our abstractions
- A child forms "dog" concept but forgets most specific dogs encountered
- Understanding of "democracy" outlives the texts and conversations that formed it
- Training data is discarded, leaving only the trained pattern

### 3. Action Loss
- Each action commits to one path, abandoning alternative choices
- We cannot maintain all possible trajectories
- Action creates irreversible path dependence
- The unchosen alternatives are permanently lost

## Implications

1. Triple irreducibility: we cannot access
   - What was abstracted away
   - What experiences trained our abstractions
   - What choices we abandoned
2. This creates fundamental epistemic barriers
3. Not a metaphysical divide but an information structure issue
