The Epistemic Lock of Qualia

# We Can't Define Qualia

We can't define qualia because every attempt to do so collapses into a cycle of synonymous paraphrases. One cannot define qualia in terms of experience without invoking the notion of experience itself. Saying that qualia are "felt feelings" or "what it is like" simply replaces one undefined term with another, each circling back to the same ineffable core. Attempts to specify them as "intrinsic, immediate, non relational features of awareness" or "raw, subjective, first person aspects of consciousness" do nothing more than gesture at an intuition we already possess. This irreducible "thisness" that meets our awareness resists third person analysis, yet every act of defining is inherently a third person method—structural, functional, or relational. Definition, by its very nature, operates within a system of conceptual distinctions, but qualia appear to stand outside such a system. This raises the question: is definition itself a fundamentally third person act, incapable of capturing the first person reality of qualia? If so, then philosophy of consciousness is uniquely burdened—it cannot even define its primary subject.

# We Can't Argue or Question Qualia

We can't argue or question qualia in any traditional philosophical sense. Chalmers, for instance, asks, "Why does it feel like something?"—but the very formulation of this question assumes a causal, third person perspective. A "why" question presupposes a mechanistic, explanatory framework that qualia refuse to enter. His conceivability argument follows a similar pattern: it starts from third person logical conceivability and claims to derive first person conclusions about consciousness. If qualia are definitionally irreducible to physical or functional descriptions, then any question about their causal role or origin misapplies the logic of third person explanation to a domain that does not operate within it. Nagel's famous question, "What is it like to be a bat?" assumes we can meaningfully probe the subjective character of another conscious entity, but if qualia are in principle inaccessible even in our own case, then such a question presupposes too much. Every attempt to question or argue about qualia seems to smuggle in assumptions that do not hold.

# We Can't Introspect Qualia

We can't introspect qualia in any deep or revealing way. While the brain itself operates as a massively distributed system, experience presents itself as unified. This unification is not a direct insight into the brain’s workings but a product of two pressures: (1) the need to accumulate experience in an integrated way for generalization and future action, and (2) the need to act in a serial, temporally ordered manner, imposed by bodily and environmental constraints. What introspection delivers is not a transparent window into qualia but a user interface—a constructed, behavioral semantic unity that hides the distributed nature of neural activity. If introspection were reliable, it would reveal qualia in their unmediated state, but what it actually reveals is an abstraction shaped by cognitive and functional necessities. Thus, introspection into qualia does not get us closer to their true nature—it only reinforces their elusiveness.

# What Remains?

What remains? We cannot explain the contents of qualia (Nagel) or their causal origins (Chalmers) because these are beyond the scope of linguistic and conceptual activities. We cannot meaningfully argue about their nature, as arguments rely on inference structures that qualia do not seem to obey. We cannot define them, as definition requires relational distinctions that qualia inherently resist. Even introspection, our primary tool for accessing the first person realm, does not grant us a privileged view but instead returns an opaque, constructed representation. If qualia are beyond definition, explanation, argumentation, and introspection, then they seem epistemically locked away—an island in the conceptual landscape that we can gesture at but never truly map.
