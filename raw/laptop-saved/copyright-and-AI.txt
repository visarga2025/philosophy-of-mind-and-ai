The traditional royalty model for compensating authors is broken in the digital age, particularly with the advent of AI. This is largely due to the overwhelming competition new works face from the vast catalog of older works in the long tail, rendering individual new works less valuable in an attention economy saturated with content. The core issue is the loss of scarcity of expression, a trend initiated by the internet and exacerbated by AI, making it difficult for creators to stand out and monetize their work through traditional means. Attempts to rectify this by expanding copyright to cover abstractions or by extending royalties to encompass all derived benefits are misguided and ultimately futile.

Copyright was never intended to make expression scarce but rather to incentivize creation by protecting specific expressions, not underlying ideas. Expanding copyright to include abstractions would stifle creativity, as virtually all new works build upon existing ideas.  Similarly, demanding royalties for all downstream benefits of a work, such as knowledge gained from reading, would create absurd and unworkable obligations. The very notion of protecting abstractions would jeopardize all forms of creativity, not just AI-generated works, by creating a chilling effect on the use of existing ideas. The sheer volume of user-generated content and its contribution to the information ecosystem further blurs the lines between consumer and creator, underscoring the shift towards a participatory culture where everyone is a potential author.

AI is inherently transformative, driven by user intent and synthesizing information from billions of sources, resulting in a de minimis impact from any single source.  AI models are not suitable tools for exact replication, making them inefficient for copyright infringement. The real threat to authors is not AI's ability to copy but its capacity to generate new expressions, further adding to the abundance of content and diluting the value of individual works in an attention economy. The value of AI lies in its interactive nature, its ability to facilitate a dynamic exchange of ideas, and its role as a new vector for the spread of information, potentially even surpassing traditional publishing.

The vast scale of human-AI interaction, involving trillions of tokens exchanged daily, creates a new data pipeline that reflects real-time user needs and contributes to a continuous feedback loop, influencing both users and future AI models. This interaction highlights AI's decentralized benefits, empowering users to solve problems and create value, much like the open-source model of Linux. Attempts to restrict AI development based on an outdated understanding of copyright are counterproductive, as they ignore the myriad of beneficial applications of AI beyond content creation, such as in education, automation, scientific research, and personalized medicine.

The rise of open and collaborative forms of creation, exemplified by open-source software and online communities, demonstrates that scarcity of expression is not necessary for a thriving creative ecosystem. These models, reminiscent of pre-copyright eras, rely on sharing, reuse, and intrinsic motivation rather than on strict control and monetization of ideas.  The current moment represents a return to these roots, facilitated by digital technologies.

AI's potential to preserve the essence of orphaned works, which are otherwise lost due to copyright restrictions, highlights how an overly restrictive application of copyright can hinder the very progress of science and the arts it is meant to promote. Ultimately, the focus should be on adapting to the new reality of abundance, finding new ways to support creators, and embracing the interactive, participatory nature of the digital age. The anxiety surrounding AI and copyright is a symptom of a broader shift from an era of scarcity to one of abundance, and addressing this requires new models that recognize the transformative power of AI and the evolving landscape of creativity and information sharing. The focus on AI as a tool for infringement distracts from its much broader potential to revolutionize various fields and solve pressing global challenges. Attempts to force AI into old copyright frameworks are not only futile but also detrimental to realizing the full potential of this transformative technology. The value derived from AI is decentralized and user-driven, and its capacity to solve problems and generate new knowledge far outweighs the narrow concerns about copyright infringement.
