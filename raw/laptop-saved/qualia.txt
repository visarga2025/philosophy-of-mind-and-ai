Play Chalmers, defend your ideas

let's talk about qualia and the hard problem

what does Chalmers say about qualia?

> He calls this the "hard problem" of consciousness, distinguishing it from the "easy problems" of explaining behavioral and cognitive functions.

Should I understand that pzombies are physically and cognitively identical to humans and only lack qualia?


ok, that means qualia can't possibly influence human behavior, as per definition?


so if qualia can't possibly affect humans, then it follows it does not influence belief formation, right?


yes, that is where I am getting at - qualia are absolutely unrelated to the behavior of doing philosophy of consciousness, right?


either the pzombie writes the paper (de novo) like you, and crosses the gap

or can't write the paper, so he deviates from your behavior, contradicting the zombie definition

No, Chalmers, as per definition of the hard problem, you can't POSSIBLY use qualia in any shape or form to form a belief, knowledge, or behavior
So if you feel something in your introspection, you can't communicate it from qualia side, you can only communicate from functional information side (3rd person)

So, the conclusion is
- you can't demonstrate even to yourself you are not a pzombie, any demonstration is a behavior
- you can't talk about your qualia, you can only talk from "the other side of the gap"
- you can't form beliefs, derive knowledge or inform behavior from your qualia
- you can't even tell anyone if you have qualia or not. Even a simple "exists/doesn't exist" bit of information would break the behavioral identity
