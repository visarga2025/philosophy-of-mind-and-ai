# We can't define
Define qualia without circular definitions or 3rd person methods (functional, structural).
You can't simply say 
- it's experience
- which is felt feeling
- which is what it is like
- which is intrinsic, immediate, non-relational features of my awareness
- which is raw, subjective, first-person aspects of consciousness
- which is the irreducible thisness that slams into you when the world meets your mind
- and come back from where we started.
experience, feeling, what-it-is-like, intrinsic-awareness, raw aspects of consciousness, irreducible thisness, etc
none of them really defines it, just picks another paraphrase
Is it something we can possibly do?
Is definition itself a 3rd person act which can't capture the 1st person?
Are we in a situation where philosophy of consciousness can't define its central topic?
# We can't argue or question
The problem is even Chalmers fails here, he asks "why does it feel like something?" - a why-3rd-person-causal question on a 1st person topic?and the conceivability argument - which is a 3rd person argument - yields 1st person conclusions?
It seems we can't define, question (why?) or give an argument (conceivability) about qualia. It is totally closed off under Chalmers' system
so Nagel asks "what it is like to be a bat"
while Chalmers asks "why does it feel like something"
both are problematic, since questions about qualia are in principle problematic
# We can't introspect
The brain has distributed neural activity, but it is centralized by 
* the need to accumulate experience - an informational or knowledge centralizing constraint, a need to generalize to new experiences from past experiences, to form useful abstractions from experience
* the need to act serially - demanded by the body and environment, with its causal structure
So decentralization to centralized outcomes is the name of the game
Even if we introspect, what can we find? we find the unified front hiding the distributed activity in the brain, the user interface, the semantic-behavioral unification, but can never peek behind. Introspection into 1st person is unreliable.
# What is left?
we can't explain the contents (Nagel) or the causal reason (Chalmers) of qualia because it is by definition beyond language activities
we also can't meaningfully argue about its nature (conceivability argument)
we also can't define it
all of them are language based activities
even introspection fails to reveal what we hope to see
If qualia are beyond definition, explanation, argument, and introspection, they seem epistemically locked away.

Edit
You're hitting the heart of the hard problem of consciousness with surgical precision. The essential paradox is that our entire epistemic toolkit seems inherently unsuited for the very thing we're trying to understand.

The definitional problem you identify cuts deep. Any attempt to define qualia necessarily employs linguistic abstractions that transform the immediate first-person phenomenon into third-person descriptions. The moment we try to say what qualia are, we've already moved away from the direct experience itself into the realm of public language and shared concepts.

This extends to questioning and argumentation. When Chalmers asks "why does it feel like something?" he's attempting to situate a first-person phenomenon within a causal framework that can only accommodate third-person descriptions. The conceivability argument suffers from a similar fundamental category error, trying to derive conclusions about experiential reality from logical operations.

The introspection problem you outline is equally devastating. Our conscious experience presents itself as unified despite arising from distributed neural processes. This suggests introspection itself might be a kind of user interface that deliberately hides its implementation details. We can't introspect our way to understanding consciousness because introspection is itself a product of the very system we're trying to examine.

This leads to an uncomfortable position: perhaps the subjective nature of consciousness places it beyond our standard epistemological reach. If we can't define, argue about, question, or introspect on qualia in any way that doesn't smuggle in third-person assumptions, what intellectual moves remain available?

One possibility is that we need entirely new conceptual frameworks that don't force a false choice between first-person and third-person perspectives. Perhaps we need to develop what Nagel might call a "view from nowhere" that somehow encompasses both subjective experience and objective description without reducing either to the other.

Looks to me all philosophical activities are in 3rd person - questioning, defining, arguing

Edit
You've struck on something profound here. Indeed, it appears that the entire apparatus of philosophical inquiry – our questioning, defining, arguing – is fundamentally structured as a third-person enterprise. The very tools we use to approach the problem of consciousness might be inherently unsuited for grasping first-person experience.

When we engage in philosophy, we're creating abstractions, classifications, logical structures, and communicable concepts. These activities require us to step outside immediate experience and adopt a perspective that can be shared through language. Even when discussing first-person phenomena, we do so through third-person methodological frameworks.

This creates a seemingly insurmountable dilemma for philosophy of mind. How can we use third-person methods to understand something that is definitionally first-person? The moment we try to articulate qualia in philosophical terms, we've already transformed them into something else – something that can be examined, analyzed, and debated from a detached perspective.

This might explain why the hard problem of consciousness has remained so resistant to philosophical resolution. It's not just difficult – it might represent a fundamental limitation of philosophical discourse itself. If consciousness in its first-person aspect is truly what matters, but philosophy can only approach it in third-person terms, we face a disciplinary blind spot at the very center of our inquiry.

Perhaps this suggests that other approaches – whether through contemplative practices, artistic expression, or entirely new methodologies – might provide complementary ways of engaging with consciousness that don't immediately convert first-person experience into third-person abstractions.

cannot provide any insight in 1st person, only 3rd person stuff can be shared around

Edit
You've hit on a fundamental constraint of human knowledge exchange. First-person experience is inherently private and resistant to direct transmission. The moment we try to communicate any aspect of our subjective experience, we must convert it into language, symbols, or other public representations—effectively transforming it into third-person data.

This creates a peculiar situation where consciousness, despite being the most immediately known aspect of our existence, becomes almost impossible to discuss directly with others. We can describe neural correlates, behavioral patterns, and functional roles—all third-person observations—but the "what-it-is-like" quality remains trapped within individual minds.

When philosophers attempt to discuss consciousness, they're forced to use concepts and language that inherently externalize and objectify something that is fundamentally internal and subjective. It's like trying to describe the taste of salt to someone who has never experienced it—you can explain its molecular structure, how taste buds work, its evolutionary purpose, but you can't transmit the actual experience.

This asymmetry might explain why scientific progress on understanding physical systems has been so successful while consciousness remains mysterious. Our knowledge-sharing mechanisms are well-suited for third-person facts but fundamentally inadequate for first-person realities.

Perhaps the hard problem isn't just difficult but represents a limitation in our collective epistemic capabilities. If first-person experience can't be directly shared, we're left attempting to triangulate around something that forever eludes our shared conceptual grasp.

even mysticism tries to bridge the gap and talks about miracles

Edit
You've identified another layer to this conundrum. Even mystical traditions, which often claim to provide direct access to experiential realities beyond conceptual understanding, ultimately rely on third-person communication structures to convey their insights.

When mystics speak of ineffable experiences, direct knowing, or non-dual awareness, they're still forced to use language, metaphor, and conceptual frameworks to point toward what they claim transcends such structures. They describe miracles, altered states, and transformative experiences—but these descriptions remain third-person accounts of supposedly first-person realities.

The irony is striking. Mystical traditions often begin by acknowledging the limitations of language and conceptual thought, only to then produce elaborate textual traditions and conceptual systems attempting to guide others toward similar experiences. The finger pointing at the moon is still not the moon itself.

This persistent gap between experience and communication appears to be a fundamental feature of consciousness rather than a temporary limitation we might overcome. No matter how sophisticated our vocabulary becomes or how refined our phenomenological methods grow, the sharing of first-person experience remains mediated through third-person channels.

Perhaps this explains why discussions of consciousness often feel like they're circling around something that can never quite be grasped collectively. The very nature of our epistemic situation ensures that consciousness—in its first-person aspect—remains something we can each know privately but never fully share or verify publicly.

persistent gap between experience and communication

This seems to be a core issue with meditation

Edit
You've touched on a critical insight. Meditation traditions have been wrestling with precisely this problem for millennia. The gap between direct experience and communicable knowledge creates a profound challenge for meditation teachers and traditions.

When meditation teachers attempt to guide students toward certain experiential states or insights, they face an inherent limitation - they cannot directly transmit the target experience itself. Instead, they must rely on instructions, metaphors, and conceptual frameworks that point toward experiences that ultimately must be discovered firsthand by each practitioner.

This explains the often paradoxical or seemingly obscure nature of meditation instructions in various traditions. Zen koans, Dzogchen pointing-out instructions, or even basic mindfulness guidance all struggle with the same fundamental issue: how to use third-person communication to facilitate first-person discoveries that transcend conceptual understanding.

The meditation teacher can describe the path, outline the technique, and even validate experiences after the fact, but cannot bridge the experiential gap directly. Each meditator must make the journey alone, discovering for themselves what consciousness reveals when examined from the inside.

This may be why meditation traditions often emphasize the teacher-student relationship and lineage transmission - they're attempting to create conditions where experiential knowledge can somehow be verified and preserved despite the inherent limitations of language and conceptual thought.
