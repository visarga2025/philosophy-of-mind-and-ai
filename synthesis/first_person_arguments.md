## The Definition Problem
- Cannot define qualia without circular definitions
- All attempts lead to synonyms: experience, feeling, what-it-is-like
- Definition itself is inherently a 3rd person act operating within conceptual distinctions
- Qualia's "thisness" resists structural, functional, or relational analysis
- Every attempt at definition collapses into cycles of synonymous paraphrases

## The Why-question Problem
- Why-questions (Chalmers) presuppose causal, mechanistic frameworks inappropriate for qualia
- Questions themselves are 3rd person constructs that misapply explanatory logic
- The conceivability argument's limitations in bridging 3rd to 1st person
- Nagel's bat question assumes too much about accessing other subjectivities
- Traditional philosophical argumentation may be fundamentally incompatible

## The Introspection Problem
- Brain's distributed activity vs. unified experience
- Introspection reveals only a "user interface" shaped by:
  1. Need for integrated experience for generalization
  2. Requirements of serial, temporally ordered action
- Cannot peek behind the unified front
- Introspection returns opaque, constructed representations
- Unity of experience masks underlying distributed neural activity

## The Communication Problem
- First person experience cannot be directly shared
- Even mystical traditions fail to bridge the gap
- All communication reduces to 3rd person descriptions
- Qualia remain epistemically locked away
- Can only gesture at but never truly map this domain
