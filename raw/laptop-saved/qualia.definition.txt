# We can't define

Define qualia without circular definitions or 3rd person methods (functional, structural).

You can't simply say 
- it's experience
- which is felt feeling
- which is what it is like
- which is intrinsic, immediate, non-relational features of my awareness
- which is raw, subjective, first-person aspects of consciousness
- which is the irreducible thisness that slams into you when the world meets your mind
- and come back from where we started.

experience, feeling, what-it-is-like, intrinsic-awareness, raw aspects of consciousness, irreducible thisness, etc
none of them really defines it, just picks another paraphrase

Is it something we can possibly do?
Is definition itself a 3rd person act which can't capture the 1st person?
Are we in a situation where philosophy of consciousness can't define its central topic?

# We can't argue or question
The problem is even Chalmers fails here, he asks "why does it feel like something?" - a why-3rd-person-causal question on a 1st person topic?and the conceivability argument - which is a 3rd person argument - yields 1st person conclusions?
It seems we can't define, question (why?) or give an argument (conceivability) about qualia. It is totally closed off under Chalmers' system

so Nagel asks "what it is like to be a bat"
while Chalmers asks "why does it feel like something"
both are problematic, since questions about qualia are in principle problematic

# We can't introspect

The brain has distributed neural activity, but it is centralized by 
* the need to accumulate experience - an informational or knowledge centralizing constraint, a need to generalize to new experiences from past experiences, to form useful abstractions from experience
* the need to act serially - demanded by the body and environment, with its causal structure
So decentralization to centralized outcomes is the name of the game
Even if we introspect, what can we find? we find the unified front hiding the distributed activity in the brain, the user interface, the semantic-behavioral unification, but can never peek behind. Introspection into 1st person is unreliable.

# What is left?

we can't explain the contents (Nagel) or the causal reason (Chalmers) of qualia because it is by definition beyond language activities
we also can't meaningfully argue about its nature (conceivability argument)
we also can't define it
all of them are language based activities
even introspection fails to reveal what we hope to see

If qualia are beyond definition, explanation, argument, and introspection, they seem epistemically locked away.
