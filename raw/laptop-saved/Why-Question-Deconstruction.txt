Let's deconstruct "why does it feel like something" and "why is there subjective experience"

# The meaning of the Why question:

Frame: From what reference frame are we asking about qualia? 
Cognitive: "What are the limits of introspection?"
Causal: "How does subjective experience arise from distributed systems?"
Conditional: "What is the cause or condition necessary for subjectivity?"
Existential: "Why is there something rather than nothing?"
Necessity: "Why do I need to feel?"
Epistemic (Verification): "How do we know we feel like something?"
Epistemic (Definition): "What is known when we say we feel like something?"
Source: "Is this an introspection or a belief?"
Subject: "Who has this felt experience?"
Relational: "Is felt experience derived from body and environment?"
Contrastive: "Why is there subjective experience instead of just blind computation?"
Contrasts alternatives: Why feeling rather than mere information processing?
Expanded Interpretations (Filling Gaps)
Teleological: "What is the goal or function of feeling like something?"
Adds a purpose-driven angle: Does subjective experience serve an evolutionary or behavioral role?
Ontological: "What kind of thing is subjective experience that it feels like something?"
Comparative: "Why does it feel like something to us but perhaps not to other systems (e.g., machines)?"
Modal: "Could it have been otherwiseâ€”could experience not feel like anything?"
Tautological: "Is this question like asking why gravity is pull-y?"
Learned: Is feeling something learned? does past qualia influence present qualia?
Perspective: Is this a question about why there is a perspective, or why there is a reality?
Negative: What would be the other alternative to feeling?
Normativity: Is this a goal question? is the why implying for what purpose?

What is this question useful for?

# Analyzing the implications of "felt experience"

Centralization: "Why is felt experience centralized? Can we feel distributed activity in the brain?"
Coherence: "Why is it coherent? Can we even experience what falls outside our abstraction space?"
Vividness: "Why is it vivid? Is it because we discard information in order to abstract?"
Irreducibility: "Why does it feel irreducible?"
Temporality: "Can we experience a static or timeless state? Is temporality a necessary quality of qualia?"
Privacy: "Why is it private and inaccessible to others? Is this a feature or a limit?"
Agency: "Why does it feel tied to a sense of self or doership?"
Variability: "Why does it differ across individuals or moments? Is it inherently malleable?"
Necessity: "Why does it feel essential to being alive or aware?"
Perspective: Is experience frame dependent? Does it imply frame assumptions?
Residual: Could there be a quality beyond structure? What is left after accounting for centralization, coherence, etc.

Assuming the question and the centralized semantics and linearized behavior of the brain, what kind of answer could we possibly give?


# What makes an accepted answer? 

Perspective: "Should the answer come from 1st person or 3rd person?"
Type: "Should it be a 'does-answer' (causal) or an 'existence-answer' (ontological)?"
Role: "Is feeling what qualia does (function) or what qualia is (essence)?"
Completeness: "Must it explain all aspects (centrality, vividness, etc.) or just the core question?"
Testability: "Should it be verifiable through experiment, introspection, or logic alone?"
Coherence: "Must it align with existing knowledge of brain, behavior, and physics?"
Satisfactoriness: "Does it need to feel intuitively fulfilling, or is logical closure enough?"
Scope: "Should it apply universally (all conscious beings) or just to humans?"
Coherence: "What makes us think we could step outside experience to explain it?"
